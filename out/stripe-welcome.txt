You can view your payments and a variety of other information about your account
right from your dashboard.

If you haven't finished your integration, you might find our docs
[https://stripe.com/docs] handy.

Once you're ready to start accepting payments, you'll just need to use your live
API keys [https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fapikeys] instead of
your test API keys. Your account can simultaneously be used for both test and
live requests, so you can continue testing while accepting live payments. Check
out our tutorial about account basics [https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard] .

Finally, we've put together a quick checklist
[https://stripe.com/docs/checklist/website] to ensure your website conforms to
card network standards.

We'll be here to help you with any step along the way. You can find answers to
most questions and get in touch with us on our support site
[https://support.stripe.com/] .
